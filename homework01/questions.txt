1.3 (second function) Is the equation separable by taking the integral (basically, is integration enough to show that it is separable?)
2.4 

a. It takes 5 total operations per pixel for box_convolution to return a matrix.

b.  How should we compare box_convolution/convolution/separable_convolution? Compare operations per pixel, multithreading, etc.?
